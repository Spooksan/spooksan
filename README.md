<h4>
I'm a Software Engineer. Also, you can also call me a product designer, fullstack developer, frontend, UI, UX or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 5 years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines, manager, digital marketing professional, and more. I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
